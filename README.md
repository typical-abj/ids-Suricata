# ids-Suricata
Network-based IDS using Suricata for alert monitoring.
This project implements a basic network-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Suricata for traffic inspection and displaying alerts and logs through a web interface.

The focus is on understanding rule-based intrusion detection, alert generation, and the practical challenges of monitoring network traffic.
